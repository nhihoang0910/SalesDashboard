# Cornucopia Sales Analysis (2022-2024)

# Project Background
Cornucopia Natural Market & Deli, founded in 1989, is a women-owned local grocery store that focuses on providing healthy and affordable food and daily products. As a Data Analytics Intern, I used Excel to clean data and use Tableau extract insights on the store performance, identify top-performing departments, and deliver recommendations to increase sales. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas

- **Total Sales** 
- **Total Profit** 
- **Total Transaction** 
- **Average Basket Value (ABV)** 

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesVisualization_17337025763500/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

For privacy concern, the Excel files used for this dashboard will not be included. 


# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The datasets I work with consists of 3 tables: Overall Sales, Sales by Departments, COGS 
- **Sales:** This table contains number of total sales, total transaction, and ABV for each month from 2022 to 2024
- **Sales by Department:** This table contains number of sales for each department, including: Alcohol, Body Care, Cheese, Choc/Candy, Deli, Eat In, Grocery, Produce, Supplements, General Merchandise, Soft Drinks, and Wholesale
- **Cost of Goods Sold:** This table contains the Cost of Goods Sold percentages, which are used for calculating gross profit

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
The trends in total sales, gross profit, transaction count, and ABV have increased steadily from 2022 to 2024. The number of sales always peaked in December and reached the lowest point around January to February. The trend in sales by departments followed the same patterns over the years with Grocery had the highest record.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
